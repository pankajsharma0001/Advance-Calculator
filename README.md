## Features of the Calculator:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operators:**
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
  - Modulo (`%`)

- **Mathematical Functions:**
  - Square Root (`sqrt`)
  - Sine (`sin`)
  - Cosine (`cos`)
  - Tangent (`tan`)
  - Logarithm (Base 10) (`log`)
  - Natural Logarithm (`ln`)
  - Absolute Value (`abs`)
  - Exponential Function (`exp`)

- **Variable Support:**
  - Users can define and store variables (e.g., `x = 5`), which can then be used in subsequent calculations.

- **Parentheses Support:**
  - Full support for parentheses (`()`) to control the order of operations, allowing for complex expressions.

- **Unary Minus:**
  - Support for unary minus (`-`) to represent negative numbers, both at the beginning of expressions and after operators (e.g., `-2`, or `-(3 + 2)`).

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Syntax Errors**: Catch mismatched parentheses or insufficient operands.
  - **Math Errors**: Handles issues like division by zero or invalid logarithmic inputs.
  - **Invalid Numbers**: Catches non-numeric inputs or invalid tokens.
  - **Undefined Variables**: Alerts the user if a variable is used without being defined first.

- **Variable Assignment:**
  - Supports variable assignment (e.g., `x = 5 + 2`) with the result stored for later use.

- **Interactive Input:**
  - The calculator accepts multiple expressions in a loop, allowing users to continuously input calculations.
  - Users can type `exit` to terminate the calculator.

- **Postfix Conversion (RPN):**
  - Converts infix expressions (standard math notation) into postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) for easier evaluation.

- **Support for Floating-Point Numbers:**
  - Handles decimal (floating-point) numbers for all arithmetic operations and functions.

- **Extensibility:**
  - The calculator is designed in a modular way, making it easy to add more operators and functions in the future.
